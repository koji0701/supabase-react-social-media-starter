# Real-Time Friend Request Implementation Plan

## 📋 Project Overview
**Objective**: Implement real-time friend request notifications so users receive instant updates when friend requests are sent to them, eliminating the need to refresh the page.

**Current State**: Friend requests only appear after page refresh
**Target State**: Real-time updates using Supabase Realtime subscriptions

---

## 🎯 Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Database Layer**: Existing `friendships` table with `status` field
2. **Real-time Layer**: Supabase Realtime subscriptions
3. **State Management**: Zustand store (`friendsStore.ts`)
4. **UI Layer**: React components in Friends page

### Key Technologies
- **Supabase Realtime**: WebSocket-based real-time subscriptions
- **PostgreSQL Changes**: Listen to INSERT events on `friendships` table
- **Row Level Security**: Ensure users only see their own friend requests

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Supabase Realtime Configuration
```typescript
// Example subscription pattern
const channel = supabase
  .channel('friend-requests')
  .on(
    'postgres_changes',
    {
      event: 'INSERT',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'friendships',
      filter: `friend_id=eq.${currentUserId}`,
    },
    (payload) => {
      // Handle new friend request
      handleNewFriendRequest(payload.new);
    }
  )
  .subscribe();
```

### State Management Pattern
```typescript
interface FriendsState {
  // Existing state...
  realtimeStatus: 'disconnected' | 'connecting' | 'connected' | 'error';
  subscriptions: RealtimeChannel[];
}
```

### Security Considerations
- Use Row Level Security policies to ensure users only receive their own data
- Implement proper authentication checks in Realtime subscriptions
- Handle sensitive data appropriately in real-time payloads
