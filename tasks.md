# Profile Pictures Implementation Plan

## 🎯 Project Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for adding profile picture functionality to the GoonSquad application. Users will be able to optionally set and change their profile photos, which will be stored using Supabase Storage and displayed throughout the application.

## 📋 Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality
- Upload profile pictures (image files: PNG, JPEG, WebP)
- Display profile pictures across the application
- Optional profile pictures (fallback to initials)
- Update/change existing profile pictures
- Optimize images for performance
- Secure file access with proper RLS policies

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript with ShadCN UI components
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Storage)
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage with bucket-based organization
- **Image Processing**: Client-side optimization
- **Authentication**: Existing Supabase Auth integration

- [x] Progress indicator during upload
- [x] Error handling and user feedback

#### 2.3 Image Processing & Optimization ✅
- [x] Client-side image resizing (max 800x800px)

- [x] Update navigation/header with user avatar
- [x] Ensure consistent avatar sizing across components

#### 3.3 Friend Profile Integration ✅
- [x] Display friend avatars in Friends page
- [x] Update friendship display components
- [x] Handle avatar loading states for friend views
- [x] Update friends store to include avatar URLs

### Phase 4: Advanced Features & Polish 🚧 IN PROGRESS

### 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

Database Schema Changes ✅

```sql
-- Add avatar_url column to profiles table
ALTER TABLE profiles 
ADD COLUMN avatar_url TEXT;

-- Update RLS policies if needed
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own avatar" 
ON profiles 
FOR UPDATE 
USING (auth.uid() = id);
```

Storage Bucket Configuration ✅

```sql
-- Create storage bucket for avatars
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types) 
VALUES (
  'avatars', 
  'avatars', 
  true, 
  2097152, -- 2MB limit
  ARRAY['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/webp']
);

-- RLS policies for storage
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own avatars" 
ON storage.objects 
FOR INSERT 
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'avatars' AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text);
```

Component Architecture ✅

```
src/components/avatar/
├── Avatar.tsx              # Display component ✅
├── AvatarUpload.tsx        # Upload component ✅
├── types.ts                # Avatar-related types ✅
└── index.ts                # Export barrel ✅
```

State Management Updates ✅

```typescript
interface Profile {
  id: string;
  username: string;
  email: string;
  weeklyCount: number;
  streakDays: number;
  lastRelapse: string | null;
  avatarUrl: string | null; // ✅ Implemented
}
```

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks ✅ MITIGATED
- **File size abuse**: Implemented strict file size limits (2MB max)
- **Storage costs**: Bucket configuration with cleanup policies
- **Upload failures**: Robust error handling and retry mechanisms
- **Security**: Proper RLS policies and file type validation

### User Experience Risks ✅ ADDRESSED
- **Slow uploads**: Client-side compression and progress indicators
- **Mobile compatibility**: Responsive design and touch-friendly interactions
